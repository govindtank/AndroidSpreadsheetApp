# AndroidSpreadsheetApp
A super crappy "app" with awful UI and really no design approach, made just to have a play with Android Studio and get a slight feel for how it works

## Functionality includes:
- Save/load values written to various cells
- Use tokenisation/parsing to build an expression tree and compute expressions using the basic mathematical operators in the usual order of operations: +, -, \*, /
- Handle floats and ints
- NOT handle negatives

## Still to add:
- Fix the button layout
- Refer to values stored in other cells
